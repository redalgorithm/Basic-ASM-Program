# Basic-ASM-Program
This is a program based on the x86 ISA (uses x86 assembly language).  This basic program allows the user to enter 12 numbers (signed or unsigned), organizing them into a table, determining how many are signed (if any), and calculating the sum from positions a to b based on user preference.
